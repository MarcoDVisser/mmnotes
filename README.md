=======

The reprository contains my personal notes on inference with mixed models.
It also contains a growing library of diagnostic functions for lme4 objects.

Download the pdf with notes [here](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/mmnotes/blob/master/Man/mixedmodelguid.pdf?raw=true).

Look at the R diagnostic functions [here](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/mmnotes/blob/master/R/diagnostics.R).


Add suggestions to http://github.com/MarcoDVisser/mmnotes/issues or contribute directly by forking the repro and creating pull requests!
